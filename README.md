## Quick Installation (Recommended)

**One installer for every platform. No miniconda, no admin rights, ~500 MB on disk.**

### Windows
1. Download: [install.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ack00gar/FunGen-AI-Powered-Funscript-Generator/main/install.bat)
2. Double-click to run.

### Linux / macOS
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ack00gar/FunGen-AI-Powered-Funscript-Generator/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:
- Installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) once (~15 MB) if you don't already have it
- Creates a self-contained `.venv` next to FunGen with Python 3.11
- Detects your GPU (NVIDIA Blackwell / NVIDIA stable / AMD ROCm / Apple MPS / CPU) and installs the matching PyTorch wheels
- Creates launcher scripts: `launch.bat` (Windows), `launch.command` (macOS, Finder), `launch.sh` (Linux / macOS Terminal)

If a previous FunGen install used miniconda, the installer detects it at the end and asks (once) whether to clean it up. It never touches conda silently and never removes other conda envs.

**That's it.** Double-click the launcher for your OS to start FunGen.

### Migrating from a previous miniconda install

Just `git pull` (or use the in-app updater) and click the launcher again. The launcher self-heals: it sees there's no `.venv`, runs `install.py` once (~2 min), then starts the app. The old `~/miniconda3/envs/FunGen` is left in place until you confirm the new env works — you'll get a one-time prompt at the end of the installer asking what to do with it.

### Fallback (if the new installer fails)

The previous conda-based installer is still in the repo as `legacy_install_with_conda.py` (with `legacy_install.sh` / `legacy_install.bat` shims). Run it the same way as the old installer if you hit a problem with the uv-based one, then please [open an issue](https://github.com/ack00gar/FunGen-AI-Powered-Funscript-Generator/issues).

---

## Manual Installation

If the automatic installer doesn't fit your setup, you can do it by hand. You only need Python 3.11 (or Python 3.x — uv will install 3.11 for you) and `git`.

```bash
git clone --branch main https://github.com/ack00gar/FunGen-AI-Powered-Funscript-Generator.git FunGen
cd FunGen
python install.py
```

`install.py` is stdlib-only and ~250 lines. It picks the right requirements file from `requirements/` based on your GPU, then installs them into `.venv/` via uv.

### Requirements files (one per channel)

| File | When |
|---|---|
| `requirements/base.txt` | Always installed — torch-independent deps (opencv, ultralytics, moderngl, etc.) |
| `requirements/cuda_stable.txt` | NVIDIA RTX 20/30/40-series, A/H/L-series datacenter cards (cu128) |
| `requirements/cuda_blackwell.txt` | NVIDIA RTX 50-series (RTX 5070/5080/5090) — Blackwell, cu129 |
| `requirements/cpu.txt` | Linux + Windows CPU-only |
| `requirements/mps.txt` | macOS Apple Silicon (MPS / Metal) |
| `requirements/rocm.txt` | AMD ROCm on Linux |

If the GPU detection picks the wrong file, you can override it by running:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements/base.txt -r requirements/<channel>.txt
```
(replace `bin/python` with `Scripts/python.exe` on Windows).

**NVIDIA 10xx-series GPUs are not supported.** ROCm is Linux-only.

### Verify the install (NVIDIA only)
```bash
nvidia-smi
.venv/bin/python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

## Download the YOLO models

The necessary YOLO models will be automatically downloaded on the first startup. If you want to use a specific model, you can download it from our Discord and place it in the `models/` sub-directory. If you aren't sure, you can add all the models and let the app decide the best option for you.

### Start the app
```bash
python main.py
```

We support multiple model formats across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Recommendations
- NVIDIA Cards: we recommend the .engine model
- AMD Cards: we recommend .pt (requires ROCm see below)
- Mac: we recommend .mlmodel

### Models
- **.pt (PyTorch)**: Requires CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or ROCm (for AMD GPUs) for acceleration.
- **.onnx (ONNX Runtime)**: Best for CPU users as it offers broad compatibility and efficiency.
- **.engine (TensorRT)**: For NVIDIA GPUs: Provides very significant efficiency improvements (this file needs to be build by running "Generate TensorRT.bat" after adding the base ".pt" model to the models directory)
- **.mlpackage (Core ML)**: Optimized for macOS users. Runs efficiently on Apple devices with Core ML.

In most cases, the app will automatically detect the best model from your models directory at launch, but if the right model wasn't present at this time or the right dependencies where not installed, you might need to override it under settings. The same applies when we release a new version of the model.


### Troubleshooting CUDA Installation

**Common Issues:**
- **Driver too old for installed CUDA wheels**: NVIDIA Studio Driver 555+ is recommended for cu128 (RTX 20/30/40-series); 560+ for cu129 (RTX 50-series Blackwell).
- **PATH issues**: The system CUDA toolkit is not required — the torch wheels ship their own CUDA libs. Just having `nvidia-smi` work is enough.
- **Right channel?** The installer auto-detects, but you can verify by checking `.venv/bin/python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"` matches expectations (12.8 for stable, 12.9 for Blackwell).

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
nvidia-smi                    # Check GPU and driver
.venv/bin/python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.version.cuda)"
```
On Windows replace `.venv/bin/python` with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

## GUI

FunGen launches with a streamlined interface. The control panel (left) has Run and Metadata tabs, plus add-on tabs for Device Control, Streamer, and Batch Processing. The info panel (right) has Info, Settings, Undo, and Performance tabs. All settings are searchable from the Settings tab. Use View > Show Advanced Options to reveal developer controls.

-----

# Command Line Usage

FunGen can be run in two modes: a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) for automation and batch processing.

**To start the GUI**, simply run the script without any arguments:

```bash
python main.py
```

**To use the CLI mode**, you must provide an input path to a video or a folder.

### CLI Examples

**To generate a script for a single video with default settings:**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

**To process an entire folder of videos recursively using a specific mode and overwrite existing funscripts:**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/folder" --mode <your_mode> --overwrite --recursive
```

**To run multiple instances on different GPUs (e.g. 10-bit on QSV, rest on CUDA):**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/10bit_videos" --hwaccel qsv &
python main.py "/path/to/other_videos" --hwaccel cuda &
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input_path` | | **Required for CLI mode.** Path to a single video file or a folder containing videos. |
| `--mode` | | Sets the processing mode. The available modes are discovered dynamically. |
| `--overwrite`| | Forces the app to re-process and overwrite any existing funscripts. By default, it skips videos that already have a funscript. |
| `--no-autotune`| | Disables the automatic application of Ultimate Autotune after generation. |
| `--no-copy` | | Prevents saving a copy of the final funscript next to the video file. It will only be saved in the application's output folder. |
| `--generate-roll` | | Generates a secondary axis funscript file (e.g. `.roll.funscript`) for supported multi-axis devices. |
| `--save-preprocessed` | | Keeps the preprocessed (resized/unwarped) video for each processed file. Off by default in batch/CLI to save disk space. |
| `--hwaccel` | | Override hardware acceleration method for this run (e.g. `cuda`, `qsv`, `auto`, `none`). Useful for running multiple instances on different GPUs. |
| `--recursive`| `-r` | If the input path is a folder, this flag enables scanning for videos in all its subdirectories. |

# Modular Systems

FunGen features a modular architecture for both funscript filtering and motion tracking, allowing for easy extension and customization.

## Filter Plugin System

Plugins are accessible from the **Plugins** dropdown in the timeline toolbar. Each plugin opens a popup with adjustable parameters and live preview. Available plugins:

- **Amplify:** Amplifies or reduces position values around a center point.
- **Autotune SG:** Automatically finds optimal Savitzky-Golay filter parameters.
- **Clamp:** Clamps all positions to a specific value.
- **Invert:** Inverts position values (0 becomes 100, etc.).
- **Keyframes:** Simplifies the script to significant peaks and valleys.
- **Resample:** Resamples the funscript at regular intervals while preserving peak timing.
- **Simplify (RDP):** Simplifies the funscript by removing redundant points using the RDP algorithm.
- **Smooth (SG):** Applies a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter.
- **Speed Limiter:** Limits speed and adds vibrations for hardware device compatibility.
- **Threshold Clamp:** Clamps positions to 0/100 based on thresholds.
- **Ultimate Autotune:** Comprehensive 8-stage enhancement pipeline with live preview.

## Tracking System

The tracker system is responsible for analyzing the video and generating the raw motion data. Trackers are organized into categories based on their functionality.

### Offline Trackers (Recommended)

- **VR Hybrid Chapter-Aware** - Single-pass chapter detection + per-chapter ROI optical flow. Best quality for VR videos.
- **Contact Analysis (2-Stage)** - YOLO-based contact detection and analysis.
- **Guided Flow (3-Stage)** - Chapter-aware dense optical flow with per-position ROI strategies.

### Live Trackers

- **2D POV and VR Hybrid Flow** - YOLO ROI detection with DIS optical flow. Dual axis (stroke + roll).
- **Oscillation Detector** - Grid-based motion detection with decay mechanism.
- **YOLO ROI Tracker** - Automatic ROI detection with optical flow.
- **User ROI Tracker** - Manual ROI definition with sub-tracking.

### Community Trackers

Community trackers are auto-discovered from the `tracker/tracker_modules/community/` folder. See the example tracker for how to create your own.

# Performance & Parallel Processing

Our pipeline's current bottleneck lies in the Python code within YOLO.track (the object detection library we use), which is challenging to parallelize effectively in a single process.

However, when you have high-performance hardware you can use the command line (see above) to processes multiple videos simultaneously. Alternatively you can launch multiple instances of the GUI.

We tested speeds of about 60 to 110 fps for 8k 8bit vr videos when running a single process. Which translates to faster then realtime processing already. However, running in parallel mode we tested
speeds of about 160 to 190 frames per second (for object detection). Meaning processing times of about 20 to 30 minutes for 8bit 8k VR videos for the complete process. More then twice the speed of realtime!

Keep in mind your results may vary as this is very dependent on your hardware. Cuda capable cards will have an advantage here. However, since the pipeline is largely CPU and video decode bottlenecked
a top of the line card like the 4090 is not required to get similar results. Having enough VRAM to run 3-6 processes, paired with a good CPU, will speed things up considerably though.

**Important considerations:**

- Each instance requires the YOLO model to load which means you'll need to keep checks on your VRAM to see how many you can load.
- The optimal number of instances depends on a combination of factors, including your CPU, GPU, RAM, and system configuration. So experiment with different setups to find the ideal configuration for your hardware! 😊

# About the project

## Pipeline Overview

Each tracker implements its own pipeline. The VR Hybrid tracker (recommended) works as follows:

1.  **Chapter Detection** - Sparse YOLO detection at 2fps classifies the video into chapters (cowgirl, missionary, blowjob, etc.)
2.  **Per-Chapter Analysis** - Dense YOLO + ROI optical flow per chapter, with position-specific amplitude targets
3.  **Funscript Generation** - Motion signal smoothing, peak detection, and keyframe extraction
4.  **Optional Post-Processing** - Apply Ultimate Autotune or individual plugins from the timeline's Plugins menu

## Project Genesis and Evolution

This project started as a dream to automate Funscript generation for VR videos. Here’s a brief history of its development:

- **Initial Approach (OpenCV Trackers)**: The first version relied on OpenCV trackers to detect and track objects in the video. While functional, the approach was slow (8–20 FPS) and struggled with occlusions and complex scenes.
- **Transition to YOLO**: To improve accuracy and speed, the project shifted to using YOLO object detection. A custom YOLO model was trained on a dataset of 1000nds annotated VR video frames, significantly improving detection quality.
- **Original Post**: For more details and discussions, check out the original post on EroScripts:

# Troubleshooting

## Installation Issues

### "unknown@unknown" or Git Permission Errors

If you see `[unknown@unknown]` in the application logs or git errors like "returned non-zero exit status 128":

**Cause:** The installer was run with administrator privileges, causing git permission/ownership issues.

**Solution 1 - Fix git permissions:**
```cmd
cd "C:\path\to\your\FunGen\FunGen"
git config --add safe.directory .
```

**Solution 2 - Reinstall as normal user:**
1. Redownload `install.bat`
2. Run it as a **normal user** (NOT as administrator)
3. Use the launcher script (`launch.bat` on Windows, `launch.command` on macOS, `launch.sh` on Linux) instead of `python main.py`

### FFmpeg/FFprobe Not Found

If you get "ffmpeg/ffprobe not found" errors:

1. **Use the launcher script** (`launch.bat` on Windows, `launch.command` on macOS, `launch.sh` on Linux) instead of running `python main.py` directly
2. **Rerun the installer** if FFmpeg is not on your system PATH (the launcher relies on system PATH to find it; install via `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS, `apt install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu, or [ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) on Windows)

### General Installation Problems

1. **Always use launcher scripts** - Don't run `python main.py` directly
2. **Run installer as normal user** - Avoid administrator mode
3. **Rerun installer for updates** - Get latest fixes by rerunning the installer
4. **Check working directory** - Make sure you're in the FunGen project folder
